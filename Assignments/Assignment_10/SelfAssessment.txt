Based on my performance throughout the course, I believe I demonstrated decent participation,
quality assignments, and responsiveness to feedback on my assignments. I attended every class on 
time and engaged with the material, when prompted by the professor I was able to answer questions.
My assignments were all submitted on time and compiled correctly. I feel like I had a strong
understanding of the material and am confident about what I learned throughout the course. As shown
in my reviews where I graded myself with 8 greens, 9 yellows, and no reds. I rarely if at all
repeated mistakes, most often my yellows were just a consequence of inefficient code, not a 
misunderstanding of the material or a repeated mistake. Although I occasionally faced challenges
with Codespaces, such as issues stemming from multiple instances of TrainLine.java and Station.java
conflicting with each other at times I mitigated these problems by utilizing outside IDEs to ensure
accurate testing and cleaned up inside Codespaces when I knew what the issue was. 

Based on the above, I propose a course grade of A.
